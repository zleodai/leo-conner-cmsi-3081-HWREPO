// A module for an expandable array-based stack of strings, built from
// scratch. This module is hyper-focused on software security, so you
// will see defensive copying, strict bounds-checking, input validation,
// and error objects prominently featured. Although the stack will grow
// and shrink as necessary, it will never exceed a really big maximum
// capacity. This is to prevent a malicious user from causing the stack
// to grow to an enormous size and consume all available memory.
